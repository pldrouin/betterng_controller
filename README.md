This is the host controlling software for the associated open source firmware for the BigNG fan controller (https://github.com/pldrouin/betterng_firmware).
This software allows the full control of the firmware. It supports configuration from the command line, from configuration files and from the standard input using two different modes (reading a pipe and with a basic prompt).
